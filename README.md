# Wordsmiths (WIP)
# Rules
Players: 1-4
Materials:
- 1 deck of Wordsmiths cards (60 total)
- 1 set of Wordsmiths letters (? total) <br>

**How to play**: Each player is dealt 6 from a randomized, shuffled deck, along with 10 letters. One player is picked to start and can choose to place a card or pick a card up. If placing a card, the player must either spell a word with the available letters that is the length of the cards number or pick up that many letters. <br>

For example, if the user plays a **6**, they must spell a **6** letter word with the letters in their hand. If no words can be spelled with the players available hand, you must **6** letters from the bag. If at any point the deck runs out of cards, i dont know yet. Once a player has no more letters in their hand, they are the winner, and the game is over. <br>
